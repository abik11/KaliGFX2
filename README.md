# KaliGFX2
This is one of my first C# projects ever. The structure and class and variables naming is terrible. It requires a lot of refactoring but it is still working and might be useful for someone.<br />
It is a WinForms app that generates ready-to-print calligraphy training sheets. Feel free to use it if you are interested.
